A simple graphics project written in C++.  It originally used OpenGL 2.x, but has now mostly been ported to 3.3.  
  
Requires Windows.  
  
Libraries used:  
GLEW - helps use OpenGL extensions  
GLFW - significantly reduces the boilerplate required to create an OpenGL window; also provides cross-platform threading and key input functionality  
GLM - provides matrix/vector classes that help replace deprecated OpenGL functions
